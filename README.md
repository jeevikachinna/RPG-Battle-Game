# RPG-Battle-Game  
ðŸ”§ Concepts You'll Use:

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) â€“ Classes, inheritance, polymorphism

Encapsulation â€“ Private fields with public getters/setters

Abstraction â€“ Abstract base class for characters

Collections â€“ ArrayLists for items or enemies

Control Flow â€“ Loops, conditionals for turn-based combat

ðŸŽ® Game Features
Two characters: Player and Enemy

Stats: HP, Attack, Defense

Turn-based combat

Simple skills/abilities (e.g., Heavy Attack, Heal)

âœ… Next Steps / Extensions
Add inventory and items (e.g. potions)

Multiple enemies and a wave system

Boss battles with special skills

Add experience points and leveling

Implement a GUI using JavaFX later
